# GeoConverter (for QGis +3.8)
My Personal GeoConverter
It is based in pyproj project.

# Info
This plugin reads a csv like file and converts points from one system to another. 
This is useful, if you want to import data from different sources in one CAD drawing
and the data has diffenent coordinat systems. 
It's possible that the conversion is not as exact than from an pro tool, but should be stil 
ok for drawings.
